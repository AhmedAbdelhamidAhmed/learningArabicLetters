Notes: Public domain 	This work has been released into the public domain by the author on Flickr, where the author has declared it as a "Public Domain Work" and tagged it with the Creative Commons Public Domain Mark.
	Public domain
The Public Domain Mark (PDM) is not a copyright license, but a symbol used to indicate that a work is in the public domain. When it is applied by the author or the copyright holder, community consensus has decided such works as being public domain in the US and countries where it is legally possible to release own work to the public domain. In the countries where this is not possible, the copyright status of the work remains undetermined.
If a file is tagged with Public Domain Mark by someone other than the author or the copyright holder, a more specific copyright tag such as one found at Commons:Copyright tags/General public domain must be applied. If this is your own work, please use {{Cc-zero}} instead
This image was originally posted to Flickr by someonefromvienna at https://flickr.com/photos/155135564@N02/38669697181. It was reviewed on 21 April 2024 by FlickreviewR 2 and was confirmed to be licensed under the terms of the Public Domain Mark.
